# Mewt
Mewt allows you to create a **hardware button to Mute and Unmute all system microphones with a single press for Windows, Mac and Linux**.  

Mewt works at the operating system (OS) level, so this **will mute/unmute all conferencing software** (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, WebEx, Blue Jeans, GoToMeeting, Skype, Slack, Facebook, Discord, etc.)

Mewt will **continuously display the current Mute/Unmute state** so you can tell at a glance if your microphone is enabled without having to search for the onscreen icon. 

When Mewt detects that your microphone is transmitting audio, it will display a sound visualizer to help you **avoid embarassing hot-mic incidents via RGB LED light indicator**. _Hot mic currently works in Windows, but not yet in Mac or Linux_

# How Mewt works
<details>
 <summary>Click to expand</summary> 

Mewt is made up of 2 parts: 
   
1. Physical components
   1. A physical button to control mute state, with a built-in RGB LED to display mute state / hot-mic
   1. An Arduino microcontroller to interface with the button and the LED. This is also what will communicate with your computer
1. Code running on your computer to 
   1. Recognize button presses to toggle microphone mute/unmute
   1. Read microphone mute/unmute state and send information to the physical components to display status
   1. Read microphone volume levels and send information to the physical components to display hot-mic

### 1. Get a button (~$3 - $20)
* $18[![deluxemomentary](/images/deluxemomentary.png)](https://www.ebay.com/itm/333311892227)

  **Things to consider**
     </summary> 

  * **Size**: too small makes it hard to press, too big and it takes up desk space.  
  * **Depth**: shallower buttons are easier to mount
  * **LED**: you can find buttons without LED lights, with a single colored LED light, with two color LEDs, or even with RGB (Red/Green/Blue) LEDs.  Buttons with RGB LEDs allows Mewt to function fully, but they are also often bulkier, pricier and more difficult to wire.  
  * **State**: after you press it once, if it stays depressed (On state) and vice versa, it is called a "latching" button.  If after you press it, the button resets itself so that you can never tell if it's On or Off by visually looking at it, then it is called a "momentary" button.  Mewt works with either.
  * **Form factor**: Mewt can also work as a toggle switch instead of a button
  * **Common anode vs Common cathode**:  Mewt works with either.  This just affects how you physically connect it to the Arduino.
  * **Voltage**: 3V-6V are best as that is what Arduinos output.  I have had no issues with 12V.  I don't think Arduinos can drive 120/220V.
  * **Resistor**: Buttons with built-in LEDs typically have resistors already and do not need separate resistors
  * **SPST/SPDT/DPST/DPDT**: Super confusing, right?  Here's a [link that explains](https://spemco.com/blog/single-pole-triple-throw-triple-pole-single-throw-spst-dpdt-etc-how-to-tell-the-difference) it. TL;DR: get an SPST or SPDT.  avoid DPST/DPDT, they're overkill.

   **Things to consider**
     </summary>

  Any Arduino model (Pro Micro, Nano, Uno, etc) should work.  Pick the USB connector of your choice (Micro-USB, Mini-USB, UBS-C), Mewt is agnostic.  
  **Things to consider**:
  * **Size**: Pro Micro is the smallest, followed closely by the Nano. Unos are pretty big
  * **To solder or not**: if you don't want to solder, get an Uno or a Pro Micro/Nano with pre-soldered headers ![headers](/images/arduino-with-header.png) and a breadboard ![breadboard](/images/breadboard.png).  _Headers are the pins that stick out from the Arduino_

  **Examples**: 

  _ | Pro Micro | Nano | Uno 
  :------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------:
  Size | Smallest ![promicro](/images/promicro.png) | Slightly larger ![nano](/images/nano.png)| Large ![uno](/images/uno.png)

  It created a variable (**a**) to be a placeholder.  It then set speed at which the Arduino communicates with the computer over the Serial port (interesting tidbit, USB stands for _Universal **Serial** Bus_) to 9600 bauds.  Remember that is also the speed that we are using to monitor the iteractions.  
  
  After that, it runs an infinite loop that checks the Serial port for data.  If there's no data, it does nothing.  But since it's an infinite loop, it will immediately check the Serial port for data again.  This happens over and over again until finally you type in "Hello World" and hit Send.  That sends the data from your computer over the Serial port to the Arduino.  The check detects data when this happens.  It will then use the variable (**a**) to temporarily hold on to that data.  Lastly, it will dump that data back onto the Serial port for the computer to display.
  
  This is why everything you type in the text box will show up in the output window after a small delay.

It sets a variable (**mewtButton**) to the Arduino #2 pin, and creates a variable (**mewtState**).  

It sets the Serial speed to be 9600, and a timeout of 50 (milliseconds).  The default timeout is 1 second, so a 50 millisecond time will allow faster responses from the Arduino.

We also initialize **LED_BUILTIN** (Arduino's built-in LED) and the MewtButton.  **INPUT_PULLUP** uses Arduino's built-in resistor so you can avoid having to physically wire in a resistor to make the button work.

Inside the infinite loop, we read the current state from **mewtButton**, which is reading from Arduino's #2 pin, and puts it into **mewtState** variable.  

Then we check the value of the state.  If it is **LOW**, then that means that the button has been pressed.  We then output that state by turning on **LED_BUILTIN** and also write **pressed** on the serial port to be displayed by the computer.  That will happen as long as the button is pressed.

If we release the button, then **mewtState** would be **HIGH**.  We then output that state by turning off **LED_BUILTIN** and also write **released** on the serial port to be displayed by the computer.  That will happen as long as the button is pressed.

   _Curious as to how these programs differ?_
   </summary>

* A **Common Cathode** LED shares a connection to Arduino's GND (-).  Arduino sets the state based on changing the voltage applied to the pin.  When you want to turn on an LED light, the code instructs Arduino to send a value of **HIGH**

* A **Common Anode** LED shares a connection to Arduino's 5V (+).  When you want to turn on an LED light, the code instructs Arduino to send a value of **LOW**

* A **Latching Button** stays locked to an on state or an off state depending on if you've pressed or released the button.  Arduino can simply read the current state to figure out if you intend Mewt to be enabled or not.

* A **Momentary Button** resets itself when you release the button.  Because of this lack of memory (or state), Arduino cannot rely on the status of the button to tell if Mewt should be enabled or not.  Instead, Arduino needs to keep track of the state inside the code with the use of a variable.

* The **PC Mewt** streams back the microphone mute/unmute state and transmitted volume (if applicable).  Therefore, Mewt can rely on a continuous state signal to decide which color to display.

* The **Mac / Linux Mewt** currently cannot stream back mute/unmute state and transmitted volume.  Mewt relies on knowledge of the mute/unmute state of the microphone at the time of button press to determine which color to display.

# How does the Mewt code work
<details>
 <summary>Click to expand</summary>
 
* **Arduino**
   <details>
    <summary>Click to expand</summary>
   Mewt's Arduino code wires the below inputs, outputs and placeholders together:

   **Input from user**
     * Button: User issues command to Mewt to mute/unmute microphone by pressing the button

   **Output to computer**
     * Serial: Arduino opens up a communications channel to pass along the user input via commands to the computer.  1=mute, 0=unmute

   **Input from computer**
     * Serial: After the computer issues the command to mute/unmute the system microphone, it passes a value to Arduino to represent the current state of the microphone.  0=muted, 1=umuted.  It is also possible to receive values >1 if the computer supports streaming microphone volume data (for hot-mic support).  

   **Output to user**
     * LED: Arduino takes the input from computer and maps them into different colors to be displayed to the user via the combination of RGB LED lights.  

      Value | Meaning | RGB | Color
     :------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |  :-------------: 
     0 | Muted | R | Red
     1 | Unmuted | B | Blue
     2 | Button pressed | G | Green
     mod 3 = 0 (3, 6, 9, etc.) | Hot-mic | RB | Purple
     mod 3 = 1 (4, 7, 10, etc.) | Hot-mic | RG | Yellow
     mod 3 = 2 (5, 8, 11, etc.) | Hot-mic | RGB | White
     101 | There's a change to the system audio devices | G G G | Flashes green 3x

   **Placeholders**
     * toggleState: for momentary buttons, this help to keep track of whether the last button press resulted in a mute or an unmute, since you cannot read this off the button itself
     * lastLedDisplayUpdate: keeps track of when the last udpate came in from the computer, helps it figure out when Mewt is no longer running on the computer
     * lastVolume: keeps track of the previous volume.  This is currently deprecated.  It was previously used to detect volume changes to allow a single LED light to be flickered for Hot-mic if there was no RGB available
     * ledDisplay: holds the value received from the computer and is used to determine which color LED to light

   **Pseudocode**
     * Read current state of button
     * Read value from computer
     * Figure out what RGB to turn on depending on value from computer
     * Timestamps last value from computer
     * If it's been longer than 1 second since last value from computer, shut down all LEDs to avoid user confusion
     * If button was pressed, turn on Green LED to provide feedback to user
     * Read current state of button again
     * If button was previously pressed, and is now released, then user has toggled mute/unmute.  Save mute state to memory.  Send command via serial to computer.

   Mewt Windows leverages the AudioDeviceCmdlets PowerShell library for its communications with system microphones.  See [Acknowledgments](#Acknowledgments)

   **Setup Pseudocode**
     * Reads command line arguments *Passing **Zoom** or **Meet** as an argument will make Mewt attempt to send the shortcut for application-level muting respectively
     * Reads the COM port to look for Mewt on from **mewt_com_port.txt**.  *should have been detected and written as part of the setup*
     * Imports AudioDeviceCmdlets library
     * If it's the first time Mewt/AudioDeviceCmdlets has run on this computer, it will install/copy the files to the correct directories for future use
     * Opens a separate process to output the volume stream of the current microphone to a file **out.txt**
     * Creates a Serial bus communicatioons using the COM port from above
     * Sends **101** to Mewt to display flashing green light to indicate Mewt is starting up
     * Clears the console and outputs ***Mewt Ready*** *for verbose mode*
     * Declares some temporary variables to keep state for last button state and ***unmewtable device*** *I encountered USB microphone that unmuted itself right after a mute command was sent that needed specialized treatment*
     * Takes a snapshot of all system audio devices, filtered down to just the microphones/recording devices
     * Starts a timer to gauge how long each press is taking to effect *for verbose mode*

   **Loop Pseudocode**
     * Take the last value from audio stream and write it to **mewt_stream.txt**
     * Queries current mute state from computer and inverts it *AudioDeviceCmdlets returns 1 for mute, but Mewt sends 0 for mute in order to more logically support hot-mic
     * If current state is unmuted, but microphone is capturing no volume, AudioDeviceCmdlets returns 0.  Replace this 0 to 1 before sending to Mewt
     * Otherwise, send last volume value to Mewt
     * Check against previous mute state to prevent unnecessary commands *sending mute when microphone is currently muted*
     * Read button state from Arduino
     * Timestamps mute state change start
     * If we received **Zoom** or **Meet** from command line argument, then switch windows focus to Zoom or Google Chrome respectively and send appropriate shortcut key *the Chrome tab that Meet is on has to be the in-focus tab for this to work*
     * Iteratives through each available system microphone and mutes them individually, making sure to save the primary microphone, and checking if there's been a change of devices *removed a device or added a device*
     * For every microphone muted/unmuted, timestamps how long it took from start to finish
     * Checks for ***unmewtable device*** *if user wants to mute, and we muted every microphone, but a microphone subsequently reports that it's unmuted*
     * Waits for a fraction over half a second and mutes that unmewtable device again *beats me why this works, it just does*
     * Once we have discovered an unmewtable device, we will save it so that we don't waste time checking it every time.  Mewt will go directly to doing a 2nd mute attempt on these devices
     * Exits if port to Arduino no longer active *if Mewt is physically unplugged*

* **Mac**
   <details>
    <summary>Click to expand</summary>

   Mewt Mac leverages AppleScript in order to set the recording volume of the primary microphone to 0 for mute, and 100 for unmute.  *There is a more robust way to actually mute microphones (as opposed to setting volume to 0), and to iterate through each microphone.  To do so, we can leverage the **Audio MIDI Setup** application.  However, this currently takes 3-5 seconds per toggle and is not efficient enough to use without further optimization.  

   **Setup Pseudocode**
     * Reads the COM port to look for Mewt on from **port_arduino**.  *should have been detected and written as part of the setup*
     * Creates a Serial bus communicatioons using the COM port from above
     * Declares some temporary variables to keep state for last button state  
     * Sends **101** to Mewt to display flashing green light to indicate Mewt is starting up  
     * Clears the console

   **Loop Pseudocode**
     * Read button state from Arduino
     * _test_data.csv_ refers to hot-mic feature that is currently being tested and not yet integrated
     * If 1 received, then mute by calling **mac_native_mewt.scpt** AppleScript
     * Otherwise, if 0 received, then unmute by calling **mac_native_unmewt.scpt** AppleScript
     * Write 1/0 for mute/unmute to serial so Arduino can display the correct status lights

     * _test_data.csv_ refers to hot-mic feature that is currently being tested and not yet integrated
     * If 1 received, then mute by calling **pacmd set-source-mute _X_ 1** _where X is microphone to be muted
     * Otherwise, if 0 received, then unmute by calling **pacmd set-source-mute _X_01** _where X is microphone to be unmuted
     * Write 1/0 for mute/unmute to serial so Arduino can display the correct status lights

# How you can support Mewt
<details>
 <summary>Click to expand</summary>
 
 All I ask is that you take a moment to do something kind.  
  
 * Think of what you would have been willing to contribute to the Mewt project (however small the amount), and donate that to your favorite charity instead.
 
 * See someone hungry or cold?  Buy them a small meal or cheap socks.
 
 * Have elderly neighbors?  Offer to help shovel their driveway or mow their lawn.
 
 * People across the political divide have you on edge?  Bake them some cookies just to be nice.
 
 * Even something as simple as given a random stranger your best smile.  
 
 If you can report back via this 5 second [#UnMewtForGood questionnaire](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DFHGL6H), it would really make my day.  I'm hoping we can push out $1000 and/or 100 hours of kindness from this little corner of the internet.
